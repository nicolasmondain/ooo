# Spotlight Integration Complete ✅

This blog now uses the **Spotlight design system** from Tailwind UI, adapted for React Router and our static blog architecture.

## What is Spotlight?

Spotlight is a premium personal website and blog template from Tailwind UI, featuring:
- Clean, professional design with zinc color palette
- Sophisticated header with animated avatar
- Beautiful typography system
- Responsive mobile and desktop navigation
- Dark mode support
- Photo gallery component
- Newsletter signup form
- Resume/work experience section

## Integration Details

### Components Adapted from Spotlight

All Spotlight components have been adapted to work with React Router (instead of Next.js):

**Core Layout:**
- `Layout` - Main layout with background pattern
- `Header` - Sophisticated header with avatar animation and navigation
- `Footer` - Clean footer with links
- `Container` - Responsive container system

**UI Components:**
- `Card` - Article cards with hover effects
- `Button` - Primary and secondary button variants
- `SocialIcons` - GitHub, LinkedIn, X (Twitter), Instagram icons

**Features:**
- Animated avatar on homepage that shrinks on scroll
- Mobile navigation with overlay
- Theme toggle (light/dark mode)
- Photo gallery with rotation effects
- Newsletter signup form
- Work/resume section

### Design System

The Spotlight design uses a carefully crafted zinc-based color palette:

- **Text:** zinc-800 (light) / zinc-100 (dark)
- **Backgrounds:** white / zinc-900
- **Borders:** zinc-100 / zinc-700
- **Accents:** teal-500 / teal-400
- **Muted text:** zinc-600 / zinc-400

### Typography

Custom typography scale defined in `src/index.css`:

```css
--text-xs through --text-5xl with matching line heights
```

### Key Differences from Original Spotlight

1. **Routing:** Uses React Router instead of Next.js
2. **Images:** Standard `<img>` tags instead of Next.js Image component
3. **Article Management:** JSON + Markdown files instead of MDX
4. **Static Generation:** Vite build instead of Next.js SSG
5. **Deployment:** GitHub Pages instead of Vercel
