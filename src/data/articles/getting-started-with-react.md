# Getting Started with React and Vite

React has become one of the most popular libraries for building user interfaces, and when combined with Vite, the development experience is incredibly fast and smooth.

## Why Vite?

Vite is a build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience. Here's why you should use it:

- **Lightning Fast**: Vite leverages native ES modules in the browser, which means instant server start
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Changes appear instantly without losing application state
- **Optimized Build**: Uses Rollup for production builds, creating highly optimized bundles

## Setting Up Your First Project

Creating a new React + Vite project is straightforward:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

A typical React + Vite project looks like this:

```
my-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.css
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â””â”€â”€ vite.config.ts
```

## Key Features

### 1. Fast Refresh

Vite's Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is incredibly fast. When you save a file, changes appear almost instantly without a full page reload.

### 2. TypeScript Support

TypeScript works out of the box with Vite. No additional configuration needed!

### 3. CSS Support

Import CSS files directly in your components:

```tsx
import './App.css'

function App() {
  return <div className="app">Hello World</div>
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep components small and focused** - Each component should do one thing well
2. **Use TypeScript** - Type safety helps catch bugs early
3. **Leverage Vite's features** - Use environment variables, import.meta, and more

## Conclusion

React + Vite is a powerful combination for modern web development. The fast development experience and optimized production builds make it an excellent choice for projects of any size.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
